<h1>Starting the Project</h1>

<p>We are going to start out with a single module (project) containing both the front and back ends. While this will
    likely change, I want to keep it simple to start with.</p>

<p>One "requirement" I forgot to mention in the first blog entry: If you're actually going to build an application like
    this, you would probably build it as a Software as a Service application. So I'm going to refactor to include this
    requirement, but I've already started working on the Vendor maintenance part.</p>

<p>Initially we are going to need to create vendors. Vendors are the companies that supply the store(s) with products to
    sell. Right now I'm not completely sure what we will need to handle vendors. I need to basically put some code down
    to start with to basically build out the vendor structure. Right now I'm just figuring out exactly what a vendor
    would consist of. I am thinking of the following:
<ul>
    <li>A UUID for the Ids. This allows us to generate the Ids ourselves instead of having a database do it for us. I
        plan on using UUIDs for all objects in the system, not just vendors.
    </li>
    <li>Vendor name.</li>
    <li>An address - the main address for the vendor. They might have many addresses such as warehouses. We will need to
        deal with that in the future.
    </li>
    <li>Main phone number - we will deal with other phone numbers in the future also.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>Take a look at the <a href="address-stories.html">address stories</a> page to see the initial address code.</p>
