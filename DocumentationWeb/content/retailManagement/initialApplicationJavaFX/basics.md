# Basic Thoughts

## Application Requirements

1. Architecture

    1. JavaFX Front End
    1. Should "back end" be server or fat client?
        1. server based on JSON makes it easier to have other front ends
        1. server based allows more flexibility on where processing takes place
        1. fat client simplifies architecture
        1. fat client makes it harder to scale
        
    * **Going to go with server based on JSON**

        1. Add/Edit Item Delivery Package
