<h1>Starting the Project</h1>

<p>We are going to start out with a single module (project) containing both the front and back ends. While this will
    likely change, I want to keep it simple to start with.</p>

<p>One "requirement" I forgot to mention in the first blog entry: If you're actually going to build an application like
    this, you would probably build it as a Software as a Service application. So I'm going to refactor to include this
    requirement, but I've already started working on the Vendor maintenance part.</p>

<p>If you are going to sell things in a store, you are going to need to get the items you are selling from somewhere.
We are going to call the companies that you get the items from Vendors. So initially, we're going to look at implementing
the Vendor stories. So jump over to the <a href="vendor-stories.html">Vendor Stories</a> page and let's get started.</p>
