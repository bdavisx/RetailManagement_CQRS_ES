        <p>This is the personal website for Bill Davis - <a href="http://twitter.com/BillWDavis">@BillWDavis</a>. It's
            not very fancy right now, I need to setup a static generator but haven't had the time.</p>

        <p>I'm a software developer in the Actuarial area for a very large US based mutual Insurance and Financial
            company. I work on Java and .Net based software. On the personal side, the link below is what I've been
            exploring lately.</p>
