<h1>Creating Components/Services for the System</h1>

<p>As I'm getting to the point of putting some "real" code down, I'm thinking about how to split things of project wise
    (or module's in the case of IntelliJ). It seems obvious that the address validation can be usable from a lot of
    different areas of the system - vendors, customers, stores, etc. So it should be a "component". But how are we going
    to define component as far as the system is concerned.</p>

<p>A monolithic system is not going to work, period. I've already discussed the fact that there are going to be
    different pieces of the system that could be written using different front end architectures, so a single giant
    application isn't going to work. So then we need to decide how to group the different items into components /
    services.</p>

<p>I think that since the address validation can be used from many different places, it should be it's own service. So
    I'm going to create a new IntelliJ module (equivalent to an Eclipse project) for the address validation. In this
    case we're going to implement something of a <a
        href="http://yobriefca.se/blog/2013/04/29/micro-service-architecture/">micro-service</a>. While I'm not
    advocating that the entire system be composed of micro-services (although perhaps I'll move that way as we go
    along), in this case it seems like the perfect solution. It's tempting to use <a
        href="http://dropwizard.codahale.com/">DropWizard</a> for this part of the system, but I'm a fan of consistency,
    and unless we switch to DropWizard for everything, then I don't want to use it for just one piece.</p>

<p>So I'm going to build a small service with Spring. I'm going to use JDBC instead of Hibernate for this part, since
the service will mainly be doing lookups.</p>
