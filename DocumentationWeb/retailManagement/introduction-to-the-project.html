<h1>Introduction to the Project – CQRS with Event Sourcing – Retail Management Application</h1>

<p>We're going to work on an application to study the <a href="http://www.axonframework.org/">Axon framework</a> along
    with <a href="http://goo.gl/ddX7vL">CQRS</a> and <a href="http://goo.gl/ADfs2F">Event Sourcing</a>. I'm going to
    create pieces of a a retail management application to explore CQRS. There may be parts of retail that would work
    better as simple CRUD - if we find that, we're still going to use CQRS, and then reflect on why doing it as simple
    CRUD might have been better. I'm not an expert with the Axon framework, I would consider myself intermediate. I
    could make some mistakes along the way, but it will be a good learning experience in how to fix the mistakes. Make
    sure you understand what I said above :), I don't consider myself to be at a point where I should be teaching about
    Axon, but if you follow along, you can learn with me - I do have a lot of experience in Java and Application
    development in general. </p>

<p>You should read the <a href="http://www.axonframework.org/axon-2-quickstart-guide/">Axon quick start guide</a> before
    going any further, if you haven't already. <a href="http://www.axonframework.org/axon-2-quickstart-guide/">http://www.axonframework.org/axon-2-quickstart-guide/</a>.
</p>

<p>I don't really know retail management, so I'm going to go from feature lists from other applications, open source or
    otherwise. But retail is an area we all have experience with from real life. Beyond just shopping, I did work in a
    convenience store and warehouses when I was going through college. I'm mentioning this because if you have some real
    retail application development experience, I might make some kind of assumption that's completely wrong, but at
    least you'll know why. I'm not pretending to know retail in-depth. I'm always open to suggestions for something that
    could be done better. While I'm not aiming for a "real" retail management application, I do want the parts that I
    create to be as realistic as possible. </p>

<p>What I do create will be open source (the github repository is <a
    href="https://github.com/bdavisx/RetailManagement_CQRS_ES">https://github.com/bdavisx/RetailManagement_CQRS_ES</a>
    and hopefully a learning experience for anyone who finds this blog. I'm going to be developing with <a
        href="http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/">IntelliJ IDEA</a> for writing the code and <a
        href="http://www.gradle.org/">Gradle </a>for the builds. I'll be using <a href="http://tomcat.apache.org/">Tomcat </a>for
    the web container, if it appears that a full blown application server is needed, we'll switch over to <a
        href="https://www.jboss.org/overview/">JBoss</a>. I'm not an expert in Gradle, I've done a lot more in Maven,
    but I'm using this project to catch up on some areas that I feel I'm lacking in. </p>

<p>For the UI parts I'll be using <a
    href="http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/html/mvc.html">Spring MVC</a> with <a
    href="http://www.thymeleaf.org/">Thymeleaf</a>, I might throw in some <a href="http://angularjs.org/">AngularJS </a>as
    well if it seems like a single page application might be a better fit than request/response. Even with that, I'll
    still be using Spring MVC to create the REST for Angular. Some pieces of retail management UI need to be in a kiosk
    mode. If you're doing point-of-sale stuff, it's not going to work as a regular web application. I know you can do a
    lot with HTML5, but a real point-of-sale system has cash registers and such. You're going to need to be able to
    interface with the cash drawer, bar code scanners and possibly other pieces of hardware. So we might be looking at
    some kind of GUI - since we're using Java (or at least JVM based languages), this means JavaFX, Swing or SWT. There
    are other ways of creating a GUI in Java, but those are the top frameworks. Since we're really wanting to learn and
    build the CQRS part of the application, we may not need to worry about the GUI. Our design would likely have a GUI
    communicating with REST to a back end, so we may just ignore the front end as much as possible. I haven't really
    decided yet.</p>

<p>For the data side, <a href="http://www.mongodb.org/">Mongo</a> for the event sourcing and <a
    href="http://www.postgresql.org/">PostgreSQL</a> for the query side. The reason I'm using separate databases is that
    in a lot of enterprises, you're going to need to be able to end up with data in a relational database. </p>

<p>So that's the basic plan. Like any project, it could change, so we'll see where it goes.</p>
