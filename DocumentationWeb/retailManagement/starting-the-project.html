<h1>Starting the Project</h1>

<p>Going to start out with a single module (project) containing both the front and back ends. While this will likely
    change, I want to keep it simple to start with.</p>

<p>One "requirement" I forgot to mention in the first blog entry: If you're actually going to build an application like
    this, you would probably build it as a Software as a Service application. So I'm going to refactor to include this
    requirement, but I've already started working on the Vendor maintenance part.</p>

<p>So how I envision this basically is that initially working the need to create vendors so when I was needed a lot of
    other stuff but initially were in a creative vendor and while I do want try practice doing test driven development
    as much as possible I need to basically put some code down to start with two basically build out the vendor
    structure of this may not exactly be land up with and I'm actually writing any code for the most part right now I'm
    just actually kind of figuring out exactly what a vendor would be made of so one thing at this point outside the ID
    obviously is that Renita vendor name and working to need an address what I what I call a main address for the vendor
    they might have many addresses abandoned warehouses in such and will and will get to that in the future and they
    will also have a main phone number so we need to model out on music term model loosely we need to model out the
    address and phone number so you might initially take a pass at having everything is strings and the address but you
    might want to go take a look at the object calisthenics document so at a link to that where it talks about basically
    everything being an object and not using stringent primitives and we also might want to take a look at I think it is
    primitive and the know it's actually called primitive Obsession where basically you're using primitives and places
    where you should really be using objects now creating an object for each of the types in the address so we address
    lines a locality the region postal code in the country that might seem like overkill but I'd don't think it will be
    in terms of validation and things like that in the future I'm especially since we want this to be international
    application think word in the we are going to need pluggable validation on the address stuff this should probably go
    before a lot of the previous tell them that we are facing the address class itself on the stack overflow answer
    that's linked in the address class Java.also include a link to the second link in the address class Java.I so they
    can get some idea of all the different variations and that time we could certainly consider that to be future
    requirement or requirements I'm not exactly sure how to phrase it but that we could use that to build our pluggable
    validation based on where our customers come from so hopefully the address lines are self-explanatory than they feel
    that sort of a free-form text area up to four lines according to that's stack overflow post where they can do
    whatever the locality would also be called normally be called city in the US anyway the region would be considered
    the state in the United States postal code postal code in the country to country so hopefully gunnels are
    understandable if not take a look at the two links so once we build those classes then we will need to consider
    validation how to do some type of pluggable validation on those and not getting get to that this evening but will
    hopefully pick up on that tomorrow.</p>
